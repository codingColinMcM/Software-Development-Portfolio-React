# reactPortfolio

## Description 

A portfolio using React.js as the front end to create a responsive UI. Here, you will be given a brief summary of my Software development career, be shown my projects 
that I take the most pride in, be able to view and download my resume, and email me from the web application itself. You also be able to click on the icons at the 
bottom of each webpage to be taken to either my GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, or Stackoverflow.
