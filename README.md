# Software-Development-Portfolio-React

## Description 
Problem:

As an employer seeking candidates experienced in building web applications, I need a way to assess potential employees by viewing their deployed React portfolio of work samples. The portfolio should adhere to specific criteria, enabling me to determine if the candidate is suitable for an open position.

Solution:

To address this requirement, I have developed a single-page application portfolio for web developers. The portfolio satisfies the given acceptance criteria, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for employers evaluating candidates. The solution involves the following steps:

1. Creating a well-structured React application that encompasses the entire portfolio.
2. Designing a header section that prominently displays the developer's name and incorporates a navigation menu for easy access to different sections of the portfolio.
3. Implementing navigation titles, such as "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume," which are presented in the header section. The current section's title is highlighted, providing visual feedback to the user.
4. Employing smooth navigation behavior that allows clicking on a navigation title to display the corresponding section below the header without reloading the entire page. The selected title remains highlighted, enhancing the user experience.
5. Setting the default selection to the "About Me" section when loading the portfolio for the first time, ensuring that employers immediately receive an overview of the developer.
6. Crafting the "About Me" section to showcase a recent photo or avatar of the developer along with a concise bio, providing employers with an initial impression of the candidate.
7. Developing the "Portfolio" section, which presents titled images of six applications developed by the developer. Each image links to both the deployed application and the corresponding GitHub repository, allowing employers to explore the candidate's work in detail.
8. Constructing the "Contact" section, which features a user-friendly form with fields for name, email address, and a message. Employers are notified when a field is required or when an invalid email address is entered, ensuring accurate and complete information.
9. Implementing the "Resume" section, including a link to download the developer's resume and a comprehensive list of the developer's proficiencies, enabling employers to assess the candidate's skill set.
10. Designing a footer that presents text or icon links to the developer's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as their profile on a third platform such as Stack Overflow or Twitter. This facilitates further exploration of the developer's online presence.

By following these steps, I have created a polished and comprehensive single-page application portfolio for web developers. Employers can confidently evaluate potential candidates based on their React portfolio, assess their capabilities, and make informed decisions regarding employment opportunities.
